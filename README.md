# BookApp: A Django-Based Bookstore Application

BookApp is a web application that allows users to explore and purchase books. It features both frontend and backend components, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the Django framework. Below, I've outlined the key features and instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following subdirectories:

1. **newFormProject**: This is the main project directory. You can rename it according to your preferences.

2. **authApp**: Handles user authentication. Users can create accounts, log in, and log out.

3. **formApp**: Admin-related functionality. Admins can manage books (list, create, update, delete, view details).

4. **userBook**: User-facing features. Users can browse books, view details, and make purchases.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
   - Install project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Configure your database settings in `settings.py`.
   - Run migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations` followed by `python manage.py migrate`.

4. **Create Superuser**:
   - Create a superuser account for admin access: `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
   - Access the Django admin panel at `/admin/` and log in as an admin.

5. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.
   - Visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

6. **Accessing Admin Panel**:
   - Log in as an admin using the superuser credentials.
   - Navigate to the admin section (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/admin/`).

7. **User Login**:
   - Users can create accounts and log in from the frontend.
   - To access the admin section, use the "admin" type account.
